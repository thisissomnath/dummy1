<h2><center><u>Computer Information</u><center></h2>
<p>A <b>computer</b> is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via <b>computer</b> programming.</p>
<h2><u>Types Of computers</u></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Analog</li>
	<li>Digital</li>
</ol>
<h2><u>Analog Computers</u></h2>
<p><i>Analog</i> computers use continuous physical magnitudes to represent quantitative information. At first they represented quantities with mechanical components (see differential analyzer and integrator), but after World War II voltages were used; by the 1960s digital computers had largely replaced them. Nonetheless, analog computers, and some hybrid digital-analog systems, continued in use through the 1960s in tasks such as aircraft and spaceflight simulation.</p>
<h2><u>Digital Computers</u></h2>
<p>In contrast to analog computers, digital computers represent information in discrete form, generally as sequences of 0s and 1s (binary digits, or bits). The modern era of digital computers began in the late 1930s and early 1940s in the United States, Britain, and Germany. The first devices used switches operated by electromagnets (relays). Their programs were stored on punched paper tape or cards, and they had limited internal data storage. For historical developments, see the section Invention of the modern computer.</p>
